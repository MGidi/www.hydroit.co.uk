Storage systems are often the most expensive equipment in modern data centers and can often be a single point of failure or the main bottleneck for an organization's ability to scale and respond to ad-hoc demands. Hydro IT, founded by Gidi Marcus, a storage specialist with 15 years of experience working with storage and Microsoft products at enterprises in London and abroad, specialized in the NetApp portfolio, IBM, Pure Storage, and Dell Compellent. Our extensive experience with a range of vendors and technologies enables us to provide unbiased recommendations for the most suitable solution for your specific needs, accurately assess the required sizing and cost models, and clearly outline the differences between options from the solution and customer's perspective.

<h2>Isn’t all the vendors are just the same?</h2>
<b>In theory – yes,</b> they all use similar commodity base hardware and provide the same set of front-end protocols. They also all claim to have top of the class developer kit, security, efficiencies technology and the integration with dozens of other products. 


<b>In practice – we’re afraid not.</b>
<ul>
<li> Vendors do use different grade of hardware, some even not publishing their actual specs – but just IOPS capacity based on unrealistic benchmarks. </li>
<li> Some behave very differently on different workload based on their backend processing (dedup, encryption, compression) and on edge-cases such as when they almost full, or when the data changes certain patterns. </li>
<li> Some developer kits and migration tools are lacking – they are performing badly, offload error-handling to the developer, badly documented and sometimes frequently change while having badly implement backward capability. </li>
<li> While they all tend to be, some are just too much of a “black box”, requiring each operation to be done by the vendor which increases the risks, limit the maintenance window flexibility, and lock the organization to not being able to do ANY operation without a valid support contract.</li>
<li> Some are not mature, too mature or just having other common use (e.g. if the vendor support 4 protocols but only one is mostly used and tested across their install-base). </li>
<li> They use very different sizing and pricing methodologies, sometimes over-spec or under-spec a solution to get to a target price. And many times, using practices to lock organization down as part of the deal .</li> 
</ul>

You may notice that from that list – many of the variable’s ire incomparable, not easy to spot during a POC or negotiation, and not publicly documented or talked about.
Therefore, it’s important to have the opinion of someone that extensively used the product – in a similar organization and environment as yours. And have seen different quotes from the competitors to evaluate the potential cost saving that can be gained with the right negotiation tactics. 

<h2>Our storage product evaluation service</h2>
The service we offer varies from a fast and straight-forward evaluation of the offer in hand. To the option of running of a full POC on your premises and your workload together with the vendors, evaluate the results and assist with the negotiation, final sizing and deployment of the chosen solution.
